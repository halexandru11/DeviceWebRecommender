# Device Web Recommender

## Description

Device Web Recommender is a web application that recommends electronic devices (phones, headphones, laptops, smartwatches, cameras, tablets, keyboards, mouses, PC's, TV's ...) to users based on price or other characteristics - e.g., similar model, facilities, color, autonomy etc.
